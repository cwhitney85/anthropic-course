Scholars argue that neighborhood segregation is not merely a spatial phenomenon, but a dynamic process of symbolic boundary-making that reproduces systemic inequalities through intricate mechanisms of cultural exclusion and institutional discrimination. These power dynamics manifest through subtle yet persistent social stratification mechanisms that reconstruct marginality across generational and institutional contexts."
